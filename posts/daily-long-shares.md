I have a running Slack thread with several friends and on a semi-daily basis I find something cool which I share to the group.  [Some people](http://tkeeney.com) like to complain that my shares are tool long and take too much time to read/watch. In an effort to collect all of my brilliant "shares" for posterity I will begin collecting them here in this post.
