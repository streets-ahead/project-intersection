Last year was nearly a big year for me - for the first time in the near decade since I graduated I almost moved on to start a new position at a new company.  While the jury's still out on how horribly misguided the decision to stay was, the whole experience forced me to finally sit down and think about what it is I really want to do when I grow up.

I assume my story is not all that different from the many who've written code before me and the many more who'll write it after. I began simply enough just developing the features handed to me working my way up to designing ever bigger and bigger components of the solution until one day you're the guy laying out the path for the whole application.  All the while gradually moving up the ladder from developer to dev lead to architect and so on - when one day you look up and realize you haven't written a line of code in months and you start to wonder what happened.  In the decade that passed it turns out I hadn't really thought much about where I was going and rather just allowed my career to happen to me.

That brings us back to the present and an unspoken commitment to finally figure out what I want out of my next career step.  I've started by trying to squeeze out a few hours to reignite some interests in a few technologies I've put off including building my first Alexa Skill and prototyping some React Native applications.  What I discovered was that even in those small little projects my creative spirit was re-invigorated.  The act of actively learning new technologies, applying it to a real problem AND FINALLY writing code again reminded me that I'm a coder dammit, and I NEED to write code.

With that surely earth-shattering epiphany on the table, what exactly is in store for me .... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯!

At this point all I really know is that while I continue to figure it out I'll work to optimize for what excites me in my current role, and until such a time that I'm able to be a claim to be a Professional Learner/Technical Prototyper I'll be:

* getting back to coding
	* finding opportunities to skip meetings and implement features at work
	* setting aside time off the clock to code on technologies that actively excite me
* continue to jump into the exploding ecosystem of conversational interfaces with Google Actions and Alexa Skill Kit
* complete a series of prototypes that accomplish some task of merit to be debated at a later time
* AND share more of the experience (because as it turns out I don't hate that either)
